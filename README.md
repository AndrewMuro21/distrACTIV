PROBLEM:
Everyone has daily tasks and activities that they have or want to complete. However, people often work on activities inefficiently with the abundance of distractors being so easily accessible in this Information Age. What should take someone a short amount of time to finish can end up taking multiple hours, if it gets completed at all with all the distractions present. Working individuals need an easy way to maintain focus on their activities and improve their work habits.

SOLUTION: 
We have created distrACTIV, a distraction logger and feedback app. By logging the specifics of the distraction that each user commits, they can become more aware about where the main causes of their distractions stem from. As a result, they can form better working habits by being more mindful of the obstacles that impede them from having productive work sessions. Through a userâ€™s accountability in properly using distrACTIV, our app promotes users to lower their distraction levels over time and be more aware of what caused those distractions in the first place.
